## 0 |  Focused vs Diffuse Thinking

**Focused thinking** is exactly what is sounds like
- Important to focus on the task at hand and remove all distractions

**Diffuse thinking** is the sort of thought that occurs when out on a walk or doing other mindless activities, letting our minds wander
- Diffuse thinking helps our mind solidify ideas and make connections therefore it's also very important

## 1 | Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

**Procrastination** is brought about by unease given a certain task but beginning the task often eliminates the unease
- Overcome with the **[Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)**
- Good to reward yourself after the task

**Working memory** is where information is stored while we're learning while **long term memory** is our internal warehouse of memory where important information can be committed to.

**Practice** over time is key
- **[Spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)** solidifies neuron pathways for information that we want to remember
- Focused studying must be spaced out to be effective

## 2 | Chunking

A **chunk** is a collection of memories and information associated with a given topic and **chunking** is the process of bringing together smaller bits of information to form chunks.
- Information is more easily remembered when grouped rather than kept individual

How can we form chunks?
1. Be focused
  - In a focused thinking mode our brain is better at connecting information to existing neural pathways
2. Understand the basic idea
  - Learning specific formulas and techniques is useless if you don't understand the basic concepts
3. Gain context + practice
  - Taking a higher level view helps connect the given information to existing concepts in memory and form the chunks
  - Practice makes perfect

We often create the illusion of knowledge by having the information present in the textbooks that are in front of us or by always having Google available. In order to better solidify the information we need to make sure we can **recall** it, or re-iterate the given information without looking at any other sources.
- Step back from reading material every once in a while and re-iterate the information from memory

**Einstellung** is the idea that we are often set in a certain way of looking at an idea or solving a problem. This can prevent us from adopting better methods.
- One way to help prevent Einstellung is to **interleave** our learning by jumping around through different concept areas or practice problems.

## 3 | Procrastination and Memory

Procrastination can be treated like a bad habit and so we can work to prevent it like so:
1. Identify the routine
2. Experiment with rewards
  - We want to identify what the exact reward the habit causes is (in this case likely mind numbing entertainment)
3. Isolate the cue
  - Identify what triggers the action based on location, time, emotions, and what actions preceded the habit
4. Make a plan
  - Determine what new routine you will adopt given the previously determined cue
