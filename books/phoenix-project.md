On pg 23 Bill restates to the CEO what exactly he should focus on as the new VP of IT.
- Restating the task given is important for clear communication

_"The plot is simple: First, you take an urgent date-driven project, where the shipment date cannot be delayed because of external commitments made to Wall Street or customers. Then you add..." [4, 53]_
- Never make external promises if they can't be guaranteed

_"Any improvement made after the bottleneck is useless, because it will always remain starved, waiting for work from the bottleneck" [7, 90]_

Four categories of work:
1. Business projects
2. Internal IT projects
3. Changes
4. Unplanned work

The Three Ways
- _The First Way:_
  - It's important to have a continuous flow from development through to customer, ensuring quick turnover with minimal friction
  - Continuous build, integration, and deployment
  - Build systems that are fault tolerant and safe to change
- _The Second Way:_
  - Have flow of feedback from right to left (customer to IT to development) in order to ensure quick detection and recovery
  - Automate tests to ensure code quality
  - Keep in mind big picture goals between development and operations
- _The Third Way:_
  - Foster a culture experimentation and improvement
  - Trying new things should be encouraged
  - Allow around 20% of time toward improvement focused and non-functional requirements
