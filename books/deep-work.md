# Deep Work
by Cal Newport

## 1 | Deep Work is Valuable

In the modern day there are three lucrative groups:
1. High-skilled worker (ex: Nate Silver)
  - have important skills, the kind that shape the future (AI, security, etc)
2. Superstar (ex: DHH)
  - these are the best of the best at what they do
3. Owners (ex: John Doerr)
  - have enough capital to invest in the future

The key to becoming high skilled is *deliberate practice* which can be achieved through deep work.
  - Switching tasks too often results in *cognitive residue*

## 2 | Deep Work is Rare

Here Cal argues that companies are moving toward IM + constant distractions is that it's the path of least resistance.

Busywork becomes a proxy for purpose in work where it's hard to define success.

## 3 | Deep Work is Meaningful

It's psychologically proven that flow = happiness and deep work = flow therefore deep work = happiness

## Rule 1 | Work Deeply

There are various philosophies of deep work:
- *Monastic* = removing all external distractions
  - good for discrete, clear work
  - Ex: Donald Knuth, Neal Stephenson
- *Bimodal* = distinct periods of monastic behavior
  - more flexible than being monastic but leveraging same depth of focus
  - Ex: Carl Jung, Adam Grant
- *Rhythmic* = regularly scheduled periods of deep work, usually daily
  - most common and easier to stick with once habit forms
  - ex: Seinfeld, Brian Chappell
- *Journalistic* = bursts of deep work whenever you can
  - made for those whom are practiced in deep work and can switch into it on a moments notice
  - Ex: Cal, Walter Isaacson

*Rituals/habits* are important when forming your deep work habit. Pay careful attention to things like when, where, how long, rules to govern the time, etc.

*Grand gestures* can often generate motivation to push yourself into deep work. Often involves putting money on the line, motivating you to try and get out more than you put in.

Cal attacks the open office arrangement arguing that a better one is the hub-and-spoke design. A really interesting ideation of this office is the *Eudaimonia Machine*.

4 Disciplines of Execution:
1. Focus on the wildly important
  - small number of critical goals
  - Cal says to make them lofty...kind of an non sequitur
2. Act on *Lead Measures*
  - lag measure = measure to describe the ultimate goal
  - lead measure = new behaviors that drive success on the lag goals
3. Keep a compelling scoreboard
  - Particularly, track the number of hours of deep work you achieved
  - Also mark milestones of accomplishment
4. Create a cadence of *accountability*
  - regularly schedule reviews of what you've achieved

Newport suggests keeping regular downtime because:
- possible to make progress on issues in the unconscious mind (*unconscious thought theory*)
- downtime helps restore focus (*attention restoration theory*)
- we have a limited amount of concentration in a day (sort of same as above)

Have a shutdown ritual that you do at the end of every work day. Make sure all tasks that are left to do are accounted for. This prevents the *Zeigarnik effect* where incomplete tasks dominate your attention

## Rule 2 | Embrace Boredom

Take regularly scheduled breaks from focus, particularly schedule when you're allowed to use the internet

Practice *productive meditation*, periods of physical occupation where you focus on a particular issue. Workouts work well here. Be careful to avoid distractions and loops. It helps to define the thinking before you do it.

Card memorization is a useful trick to practice that will boost your focus. He cites an Art of Manliness article here (go look it up lazy).

## Rule 3 | Quite Social Media

Use the craftsman's approach to tool selection: only invest in tools that benefit the core factors that determine success and happiness
  - Start by identifying the most important goals you have at the moment and focus your tools around those

He proposes you stop using certain apps for a month and see what impact it has. Just some basic methods. Social media is inherently addicting because everyone has the "you like mine and I'll like yours" mentality that creates false attention.

## Rule 4 | Drain the Shallows

Plan every minute of your day. Overestimate on tasks and leave time for alternative plans because plans never work out. You can even rewrite your schedule multiple times a day.

interesting way to quantify work: How many months would it take a smart recent college grad to learn enough to perform the same task?

Become hard to reach by forcing people to contact you only for important things (deter them with FAQs and hoops to jump through), replying to emails with actionable and finalizing answers to avoid email ping pong, or by just not responding (only when it wouldn't have much of an impact).
