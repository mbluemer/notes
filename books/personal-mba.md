There are some key rules to know **before** entering a market:

- Enter a market with competition
  - You know there's an existing market
  - Observe and learn from the competition, then make something more valuable
- Don't start a business for the money (**Mercenary Rule**)
- Don't get carried away with unrealistic ideas (**Crusader Rule**)
- Where there's a hassle there's a business opportunity (**Hassle Premium**)
  - May come from time, effort, or complexity
  - The greater the hassle the more you can charge
- The more valuable a prospect believes your product is the more likely they'll buy (**Perceived Value**)
  - This is why more aesthetically pleasing products and brands do better
  - Perceived value is unique to the prospect's situation
